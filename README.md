# bashbox
A set of bash tools and helping scripts.
The goal is to keep here some scripts used dayly, to launch it quickly and efficiently.
Also, one goal is to automate some configuration I had to do on every new installation.
For example, a list of package and application to install as part of my default kit.

This is all based on a very personal use.

For each distribution, it is possible to create a sub-folder with scripts.

To use a script : ./bashbox.sh <command> where command is a script in the distribution folder.
