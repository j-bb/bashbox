# bashbox
A set of bash tools and helping scriopts.
The goal is to keep here some scripts used dayly, to launch it quickly and efficently.
Also, one goal is to automate some configuration I had to do on eveyr new instalation.
For example, a list of paquet and application to install as part of my default kit.

This is all based on a veyr personnal use.

For each distribution, it is possible to create a sub-folder with scripts.

To use a script : ./bashbox.sh <command> where command is a script in the distribution folder.
